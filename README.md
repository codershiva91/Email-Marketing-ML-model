# Email-Marketing-ML-model

This notebook analyzes email marketing campaign data to model user engagement (e.g., click-through behavior) using various machine learning techniques. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation, aiming to improve marketing strategies based on data-driven insights.

Feature importance analysis

Step-by-Step Approach
1. Data Loading
Load campaign performance dataset using pandas.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics.

Null value inspection.

Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap.

3. Data Cleaning
Impute missing values (e.g., mean/mode for numerical/categorical).

Handle outliers using IQR-based filtering.

4. Feature Engineering
Encode categorical variables.

Extract additional features (e.g., interaction terms if applicable).

5. Train-Test Split
Divide dataset into training and testing sets (usually 70:30 or 80:20).

6. Scaling and Transformation
Apply StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler on numerical features.

7. Handle Class Imbalance
Use SMOTE from imblearn to oversample minority class.

8. Model Training
Train multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.

9. Model Evaluation
Use metrics: accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall, ROC-AUC.

Plot confusion matrix and ROC curves.

10. Feature Importance
Extract top predictors from tree-based models to interpret which features matter most.

11. Conclusion
Summarize insights for campaign optimization and future A/B testing ideas.
